{"_id":"saA1cAz2cZRnmBKF","name":"Covalon Finale Siege Instructions","content":"<h3>Hook</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Over the past two weeks an evil has been growing in Covalon. A growing sense of dread, brought about by ominous weather and shifting gloom. Covalon finds itself once again under siege by the Maw, but this time it's more cunning.</p>\n<p>Multiple copies of the Facsimilies we have been defending the Seed of Terra have risen, attempting to cut the power of the Seeds at the source by laying siege to the Heart directly! </p>\n<p>To arms, Covalon. If the Heart falls, so too do we.</p>\n<h3>The Aspect of the Maw</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When running the Aspect of the Maw, it has many different abilities that shift as the fight develops. GMs are advised to keep a token of the Aspect of the Maw to the side of the map and out of vision range in order to reference saves, hp, AC and abilities relevant to all Aspects. Keep the Aspect of the Maw's Initiative. </p>\n<p>Many of the Aspects will have abilities familiar to both you and the players from previous Expedition Finales. The Aspect changes at the end of the Maw's turn in order to give players time to respond to the coming abilities. Feel free to narrate what's coming next! Some of the abilities are slightly different however, so do keep this in mind. </p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the Maw can move 40 feet at the end of its turn. You should use this movement to place the Maw in the best location for the upcoming Aspect's abilities, such as lining up for a breath weapon, or Omegavolt!</p>\n<h3> </h3>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"8Hw3zRi2ChgFCtF4":3},"flags":{}}
