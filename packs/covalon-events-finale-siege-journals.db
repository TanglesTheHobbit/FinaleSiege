Its shifting mass continuing to morph and change, even as its intentional movements stop. The body slowly begins to disintegrate into a purple muck that soaks into the sand. </p>\n<p>This victory is significant - The Heart continues to gather power, and every second counts. </p>\n<p>Yet... more boulders assail the walls from the gloom. Covalon's brave adventurers have bought us more time with this victory, but the siege isn't over yet! You should quickly return to the safety of the walls to avoid drawing more attention to the broken section of wall. </p>\n<p>You each gain 250 exp up to a cap of Level 12, 999 exp and you also gain [[APL Appropriate]] gp as a reward from the city coffers. More than that though... You feel as if you're brimming with power, as if even greater potential is right at your fingertips. </p>\n</div>\n<p>If the party have to escape, or are defeated, read out or paraphrase the following: </p>\n<div data-visibility=\"gm\">\n<p>The Aspect of the Maw's disgusting fleshy torso opens to reveal an impossible maw, deep and void-like in its ceaseless hunger. The creature leans back before a beam of crackling, dark energy rips out from the Aspect. As the negative energy crashes into the Shrine of Terra, the Aspect diminishes and shrinks until nothing is left, its vile energy spent. </p>\n<p>Whatever damage it did wasn't enough to destroy the Heart, but we can't afford many of those before its power wanes! We're going to need to redouble our efforts and focus on keeping the Heart safe!</p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"8Hw3zRi2ChgFCtF4":3},"flags":{}}
